This repository is for demo videos showing joint camera-LIDAR calibration.
The video shows the whole process of our proposed calibration method.
However, since this software is applying for software copyright, it is not convenient to open source for the time being, please understand. We will further improve our work, and at the same time, we will open source the software for the community to learn and exchange.  

The demo video is shown below.
